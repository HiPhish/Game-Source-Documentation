Game Source Documentation
=========================

The goal of this project is to produce complete language-independent
documentations of video game source codes. A game's documentation can beconsidered mature once the information contained
is sufficient enough forsomeone to produce an accurate port from that information 
alone without need forthe original source code.


The documentation has to cover interpreting assets and implementation of game
mechanics. It is not necessary, although appreciated, to document the exact
implementation of a feature, as long as the documentation is sufficient enough
to produce similar *looking* results. Hard-or software related implementation
details only need to be documented if they are relevant, such as the endianess
of numbers in asset files.



License
-------

In short, there is no real license. For the information I have gathered feel
free to make use of it, even commercially (unlikely, but just in case). As for
information copied from somewhere else the source is always listed, so check the
source directly. It would be nice if you credit me, but you don't have to.
